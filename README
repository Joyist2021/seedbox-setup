seedbox-setup -- a bash script for diy your low end seedbox

ABOUT
=====
This is a simple bash script designed for Debian GNU/Linux and its derivatives, specifically Ubuntu. The purpose of this script is to ease the process of setting up a Bittorrent seedbox [1] on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). Of course, no one could prevent you from using it on a dedicated server or a PC. ;)

OS SUPPORTED
============
This script has been successfully tested on the following distributions:

- Ubuntu  9.10 x86_64 (w/o vnStat daemon)
- Ubuntu 10.04 x86
- Ubuntu 10.04 x86_64

Theoretically, all distributions newer than above should be supported.

CREDITS
=======
The idea of diy a seedbox on VPS is inspired by this website [2]. This script is adapted from the great lowendscript [3].
